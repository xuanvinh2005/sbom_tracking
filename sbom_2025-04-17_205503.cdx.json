This affects curl using applications that enable HSTS and use URLs with the insecure `HTTP://` scheme and perform transfers with hosts like `x.example.com` as well as `example.com` where the first host is a subdomain of the second host. (The HSTS cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs to have been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries for the domains involved to trigger this problem.) When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, this bug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for the parent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache. The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` get converted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for by the origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at its expiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the (wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry *earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlier than otherwise intended.","affects":[{"ref":"eb9d5d61-fcc0-4ed4-af03-f7a7432405dc"}]},{"id":"CVE-2025-30348","source":{"name":"NVD"},"ratings":[{"source":{"name":"NVD"},"score":5.3,"severity":"medium"}],"description":"encodeText in QDom in Qt before 6.8.0 has a complex algorithm involving XML string copy and inline replacement of parts of a string (with relocation of later data).","affects":[{"ref":"4ed127e8-e16e-42f4-8685-97909f2e2957"}]}]}
